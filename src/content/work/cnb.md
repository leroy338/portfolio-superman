## CNB

This is just a test I made to see how difficult it would be to 
create a new website for my company using Astro. We use Webflow for our marketing website, but I was experimenting. 

## What I learned

Astro is awesome and templates are super easy to use. It did take some time to figure out how to make the components work with <slots> and <fragments> but eventually I was able to get the components reusable. 

## Struggles

The biggest hurdle I'm running into is that we host a blog with thousands of posts. It is possible to pull those posts out and keep them in a database, however, it would require a frontend to be able to create new posts for our marketing teams. 

I think the best path is going to be to host it on a subdomain using a CMS framework. I'm a fan of ghost, so I'll probably look into if I can host ghost on a subdomain. 

Ghost would also allow us to send email newsletters through our existing email marketing provider. 

## What's Next

I am also working on a new admin panel for our internal teams to use to create posts. I would prefer the admin panel to just connect to a self hosted ghost admin API. That would allow us to start with the blog in its current state, and then integrate it into the admin tool in the future.
