## Weather Garden

This is a tutorial on youtube that I did. The video showed how to connect React components to a weather API and display the data in a UI. I added in a few extra features, like additional cards to display weekly weather and a tab selector which allows me to view all of the available plants that are able to be planted at this time of year. I used supabase as my backend and database. 

## What I learned

The goal was to learn how to integrate React with Supabase. It is a very simple app, but it was alot of fun to make. I learned how to use Supabase to set up a database and edge functions to query the database based on the month it is. I also learned how to use Axios to fetch data from the database and display it in a UI.

## What's Next

Next I would like to add in a few more features. I think it would be cool to integrate a search bar to lookup more information. It would also be neat to add in views for a calendar and be able to add plants to your garden.
