# Pound Town

This was a ficticious project I did as a joke for a friend. I went over my friends house and he offered me some of the pound cake he had made. It was delicious and I jokingly told him that he should sell it. It was really good. We have a local chain called Everything Bundt Cake and I told him he needed a competitive edge. Since his last name is Cheeks, I made him a logo with the name Big Cheeks Pound Town. We had a good laugh about that and while bored that night, I made this mockup for him.

We still laugh about it to this day.
