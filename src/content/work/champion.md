## Champion Golf Carts

I worked for Champion Golf Carts years ago as a seasonal tech. My brother works there in the parts department and suggested I reach out to the Owner about rebuilding their website to make it more user friendly and updated. My original design was a bit over the top and the owner wanted something more simple. Since they are already using GoDaddy and don't intend to make this a project that they have to maintain, we decided to go with a simpe design and focus more on setting up marketing. I specialize in email marketing and therefore have been making templates and automations for the company.  

### What I learned

Just because it looks good, doesn't mean that it will be a better user experience. I enjoyed building out this mockup but when push comes to shove, the owner knows what his customers are looking for and what will work best for his business. The new updates to the site are staged, simplistic and easy to navigate. There is a form with a newsletter for users to sign up for. We decided to skip the blog and focus more on data driven marketing. 

### Struggles

Since this is a highly competitive market, it was difficult to get the owner to understand the importance of having a strong online presence. He felt that having a strong product was enough to bring in customers. It is true that they have a great product and word of mouth is still extremely successful in their industry. However, with the internet being the way it is, it is important to have a strong online presence. 

### What's Next

The plan is to find ways to bring in additional traffic and thus revenue. If we are able to get more leads through our marketing, we can focus on scaling the business to be more competitive in the market. 

### Technologies Used

This one is pretty simple. We used GoDaddy to host the website and only upgraded the plan to include a higher number of email marketing contacts. Bypassing the need for a more robust website or systems to handle automations. I'm hoping we can reevaluate the website in the future as the company continues to grow.
