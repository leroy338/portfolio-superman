## Pablo & Pablo
My wife's cousin, Pablo Jr., is a painter that is trying to start his own business with his father. They are both very talented painters and they do beautiful work. They were having trouble getting their name out there and getting clients. While on vacation he asked me to help them out by creating a logo and a business website.

I used AI to create some interesting logo's and ended up creating this mockup on the plane ride home. Once back home, I converted the figma file to framer for a bit more usability and to see if he liked it. 

We are still working on adding more content to the website and getting it ready for launch. 

The main focus for this will be to get a Google My Business page up and running in his local area. We intend to start with a little social media and marketing to help spread his brand around town. 

Still waiting on pictures.
